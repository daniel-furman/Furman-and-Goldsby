## The Rheological Behavior of Firn: Experimental Observations of Grain Size Sensitivity and Application to Ice Sheet Deformation

*How does grain size, strain state, and microstructure influence the rheological behavior of ice compaction among glaciers and ice sheets?*

**Key Points**
* Constant stress laboratory experiments were performed on H20 ice powder samples with roughly uniform grain size varying from 5 to 550 micrometers (Âµm) in radius. 
*	Two rheologically-distinct creep regimes emerged, characterized by their grain size sensitivity and stress dependence: dislocation creep (n ~ 3.7, p ~ 0) and disGBS (n ~ 1.6, p ~ 0.9). 
*	Flow laws resolved the disGBS mechanism as predominantly rate-limiting for natural conditions, such as in glaciers and ice sheets.
